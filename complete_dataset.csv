Wow... Loved this place.,1
Crust is not good.,0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.,0
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.,1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.,1
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.,0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.),0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.,0
The fries were great too.,1
A great touch.,1
Service was very prompt.,1
Would not go back.,0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.,0
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli,0
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.,0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.,0
Highly recommended.,1
Waitress was a little slow in service.,1
This place is not worth your time,0
did not like at all.,0
The Burrittos Blah!,0
The food,0
Service is also cute.,1
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.,1
So they performed.,1
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.,1
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos,1
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm,1
The worst was the salmon sashimi.,0
Also there are combos like a burger,0
This was like the final blow!,1
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.,0
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food,1
 I like this place a lot.,0
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.,1
Ample portions and good prices.,1
Poor service,1
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!,0
Service sucks.,1
The shrimp tender and moist.,0
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.,1
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,0
On a positive note,0
Frozen pucks of disgust,1
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.,0
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.,1
The burger is good beef,0
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!,1
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty,1
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.,1
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.,1
Their chow mein is so good!,1
They have horrible attitudes towards customers,1
The portion was huge!,0
Loved it...friendly servers,1
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.,1
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.,0
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop,0
The ripped banana was not only ripped,1
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.,0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!,0
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.,1
We'd definitely go back here again.,1
We are so glad we found this place.,1
Great food and service,1
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!,1
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing,1
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,1
A great way to finish a great.,0
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks,1
The service was meh.,1
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake,0
I guess I should have known that this place would suck,0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.,0
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !,0
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.,0
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.,1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.,1
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.,0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.,0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.,0
This place has it!,0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,1
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.,0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.,1
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!,0
Omelets are to die for!,1
Everything was fresh and delicious!,1
In summary,1
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth,0
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before,1
Best breakfast buffet!!!,0
say bye bye to your tip lady!,0
We'll never go again.,0
Will be back again!,0
Food arrived quickly!,1
It was not good.,1
On the up side,0
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow,1
The only good thing was our waiter,1
Best Buffet in town,1
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction,1
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.,1
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!,1
The food was delicious,1
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.,1
Will go back next trip out.,1
Sooooo good!!,1
REAL sushi lovers,1
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving,0
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.,0
Nice,1
Good prices.,1
Check it out.,1
It was pretty gross!,1
I've had better atmosphere.,0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.,0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place,0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.,0
Worst service to boot,0
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.,0
The guys all had steaks,1
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi,1
Host staff were,1
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...,0
Phenomenal food,0
I wouldn't return.,1
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly,0
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.,1
Penne vodka excellent!,0
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich,1
The management is rude.,1
Delicious NYC bagels,0
Great Subway,1
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.,1
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.,1
He was extremely rude and really,1
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.,0
Don't do it!!!!,1
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.,0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.,0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.,0
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.,0
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.,1
The menu is always changing,1
The service was a little slow ,0
I give it 2 thumbs down,0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.,0
My fiancÃ© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.,0
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.,1
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.,1
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.,0
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!,0
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.,1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.,1
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.,1
this place is good.,1
Unfortunately,1
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.,0
I was seated immediately.,0
Their menu is diverse,1
Avoid at all cost!,1
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.,0
DELICIOUS!!,1
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.,1
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...,1
I've never been treated so bad.,0
Bacon is hella salty.,0
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad,1
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be,0
The waitresses are very friendly.,1
Lordy,1
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.,1
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews,1
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.,0
The atmosphere is modern and hip,0
Not a weekly haunt,1
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.,1
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland,0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.,0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!,0
It was probably dirt.,0
Love this place,1
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.,1
The food sucked,0
Interesting decor.,1
What I really like there is the crepe station.,1
Also were served hot bread and butter,1
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!),1
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.,1
When my order arrived,1
I had a salad with the wings,0
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.,0
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!,1
The live music on Fridays totally blows.,0
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.,0
Very friendly staff.,1
It is worth the drive.,1
I had heard good things about this place,1
Food was great and so was the serivce!,1
The warm beer didn't help.,1
Great brunch spot.,0
Service is friendly and inviting.,1
Very good lunch spot.,1
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.,1
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.,0
Must have been an off night at this place.,0
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms,0
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure,1
For about 10 minutes,0
My friend loved the salmon tartar.,0
Won't go back.,1
Extremely Tasty!,0
Waitress was good though!,1
Soggy and not good.,1
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.,0
Which are small and not worth the price.,1
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse,0
The service was a bit lacking.,0
Lobster Bisque,0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.,0
It was either too cold,0
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.,0
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!,1
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.,1
"As for the ""mains",1
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly,0
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.,1
Everyone is very attentive,0
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.,1
Now this dish was quite flavourful.,0
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.,1
(It wasn't busy either) Also,0
"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again.""",0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.,0
Seriously flavorful delights,0
I started this review with two stars,1
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.,0
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service,0
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.,1
Weird vibe from owners.,1
There was hardly any meat.,0
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.,0
Go To Place for Gyros.,0
I love the owner/chef,1
Now the burgers aren't as good,1
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.,0
The service was terrible,0
We definately enjoyed ourselves.,0
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.,1
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well,0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.,0
The service was extremely slow.,0
After 20 minutes wait,0
Seriously killer hot chai latte.,0
No allergy warnings on the menu,1
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.,0
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.,1
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.,1
Worst Thai ever.,0
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.,0
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.,1
The pizza selections are good.,1
I had strawberry tea,1
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!,1
Overall,0
Spend your money elsewhere.,1
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!,0
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.,1
And the drinks are WEAK,0
#NAME?,0
Also,0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,0
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
We won't be returning.,1
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.,0
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.,1
Very,0
i felt insulted and disrespected,0
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak,0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it purÃ©ed.,0
There is really nothing for me at postinos,0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.,0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!,0
What SHOULD have been a hilarious,0
Needless to say,0
This place is disgusting!,0
Every time I eat here,0
The RI style calamari was a joke.,1
However,0
I could barely stomach the meal,0
It was so bad,0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.,0
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!,0
Disappointing experience.,0
The food is about on par with Denny's,0
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service,0
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.,0
We won't be going back.,0
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.,0
This place lacked style!!,0
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12,0
Don't bother coming here.,0
The meat was pretty dry,0
The building itself seems pretty neat,0
It was equally awful.,0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.,0
very slow at seating even with reservation.,0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.,0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,0
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless,0
It was a bit too sweet,0
I was VERY disappointed!!,0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.,0
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare,0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.,0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.,0
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting,0
Con: spotty service.,0
The fries were not hot,0
But then they came back cold.,0
Then our food came out,0
The real disappointment was our waiter.,0
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.,0
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,0
Insults,0
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?,0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.,0
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!,0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.,0
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.,0
But I don't like it.,0
Hell no will I go back,0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,0
I don't know what the big deal is about this place,0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,0
The ambiance isn't much better.,0
Unfortunately,0
The food wasn't good.,0
Your servers suck,0
What happened next was pretty....off putting.,0
too bad cause I know it's family owned,0
Overpriced for what you are getting.,0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.,0
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes,0
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to,0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.,0
Food was below average.,0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.,0
All in all,0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.,0
It lacked flavor,0
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.,0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.,0
Spend your money and time some place else.,0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.,0
the presentation of the food was awful.,0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.,0
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.,0
Appetite instantly gone.,0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.,0
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience  nearly half of whom walked out.  ,0
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles  the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  ,0
Very little music or anything to speak of.  ,0
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  ,0
The rest of the movie lacks art,1
Wasted two hours.  ,0
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort,0
A bit predictable.  ,1
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  ,0
And those baby owls were adorable.  ,1
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best,1
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  ,1
It Was So Cool.  ,1
"This is a very ""right on case"" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  ",1
It had some average acting from the main person,1
This review is long overdue  since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  ,0
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay,1
"It's practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  ",1
 films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it,1
"I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  	",0
"In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  	",0
"It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  	",0
"1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  	",0
An interesting premise,0
The soundtrack wasn't terrible,0
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible,1
"Still  it was the SETS that got a big """"10"""" on my """"oy-vey"""" scale.  	",0
"Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  	",1
But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me,1
"I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea  we both hated it.  	",0
"The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  	",0
Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous,1
The acting was decidely wooden,0
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting,0
"I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  	",1
"My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  	",1
I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers,1
Wow  what a bad film. ,1
Not frightening in the least,0
The plot doesn't hang together at all,0
"Not even good for camp value!  	0",0
I wasn't expecting Oscar material,0
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming. ,0
"This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  	",0
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative! ,0
This gets a 1 out of 10,0
This is one I did not have,0
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts,0
Victor McLaglen was even bad,0
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck,0
"But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  	",0
"The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  	",0
"The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  	",0
Whatever the producer was going for,0
"I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  	",0
"I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  	",1
"Even the squibs look awful.  	0",1
"At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  	",0
The plot,0
"The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  	",0
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was,0
"The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  	",0
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush,0
"The directing is sloppy at best.  	0",0
Hackneyed writing,0
Of course,0
"The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	",0
I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down,0
I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith  but my god this was one of her best,1
"This movie contained an all-star cast  and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  	",1
This movie was kind of long in length  but I enjoyed every minute of it.  ,1
"Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  	",1
Lifetime does not air it enough,1
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning,1
"It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  	",0
Totally different,0
"This movie creates its own universe  and is fascinating in every way.  	",1
"But this movie really got to me.  	",1
"See it.  	",1
I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies  and that they will continue to do so in their own,1
And I forgot: The Casting here i superb  with Trond Fausa AurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man,1
"This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  	",1
I found this move beautiful and  enjoyable,1
Initially the local sites in the film,1
"Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  	",1
"The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  	",1
"I left the theater with a lilt in my step  joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  	",1
"Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  	",1
"The rest of the cast also play well.  	",1
"Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  	",1
"About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  	",1
"About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  	",0
By the time the film ended  I not only disliked it,0
What this film lacks is a convincing script.  ,0
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  ,0
Things happen,0
The cast is good.  ,0
For that,1
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  ,1
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  ,0
"Everything about it is just bad.  	",0
I could not understand,0
"The script is bad  very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  	",0
The casting is also horrible,0
"Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  	",0
"It is zillion times away from reality.  	",0
"Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  	",0
"Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  	",0
"20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  	",0
"From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  	",0
"His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  	",0
"And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  	",0
"Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  	",0
"(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  	",0
"there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  	",0
"the cast was great.  	",0
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged,1
"add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  	",1
"but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  	",1
first of all,0
"the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  	",0
"there is no real plot.  	",0
"i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  	",0
"STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  	",0
"This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	",1
"However, after watching the omviue after 25 years I realised how amazing it is.  after seeing the short again after about 25 years",1
"It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing """"Turkey in the Straw"""" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  	",1
"Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  	",1
The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer,1
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades,0
"The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  	",0
"I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  	",1
"This may be the only bad film he ever made.  	",0
"So bad...well...it's just bad.  	",0
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very,0
"It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  	",0
"I thought it was bad.  	",0
Both films are terrible,0
"Let's start with all the problem,the acting , was very bad",0
"The script is a big flawed mess.  	",0
Director Paul Matthews does not know how to pace his movies,0
The movie is terribly boring in places.  ,0
The lighting is awful.  ,0
The film looks cheap and bland.  ,0
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  ,0
This convention never worked well in the past,0
The visual effects were AWFUL.  ,0
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  ,0
"The ""explosion"" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  ",0
Okay,0
Gotta love those close-ups of slimy,1
"and photograph are beautiful.  	",1
"The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  	",1
"People who like European films and """"art movies"""" will like this movie.  	",1
"This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  	",1
"Go rent it.  	",1
It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me,1
"Brilliance indeed.  	",1
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet,1
"Think of the film being like a dream.  	",1
"Simply beautiful.  	",1
"Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  	",1
It's a gloriously fun,1
"It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	",1
Just whatever you do,1
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality,0
"The movie seemed a little slow at first.  	0",0
"But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  	",0
"It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the """"gadget"""".  	",1
"I enjoyed it.  	",1
"I have recommended it to friends.  	",1
"I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  	",1
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character,1
The film's dialogue is natural,1
"The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  	",1
Each track commands sentiment,1
Definitely worth seeingÂ… it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  ,1
Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili,1
"Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  	",1
"The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  	",1
If you act in such a film,1
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon),0
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time. ,0
"Just consider the excellent story  solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  	",0
Instead  we got a bore fest about a whiny,0
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th  2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  ,1
"It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	",1
"Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  	",1
"I keep watching it over and over.  	",1
"It's a sad movie  but very good.  	",1
"If you have not seen this movie  I definitely recommend it!  	",1
She is as lovely as usual,1
"Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  	",1
";) Recommend with confidence!  	",1
"This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  	",1
":) Anyway  the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	",1
The opening sequence of this gem is a classic,1
"Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  	",1
"Lange had become a great actress.  	",1
"It looked like a wonderful story.  	",1
"I never walked out of a movie faster.  	",1
"I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  	",0
Unfortunately  any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  ,0
In a word  it is embarrassing.  ,0
"Exceptionally bad!  	",0
"All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  	",0
